# beanwatch
Beanwatch is a small tool that can monitor log files on remote hosts in real time and execute remote host commands. The entire architecture is a distributed architecture, and the agent supports multi-machine expansion (the server has not tested how much it supports). The transmission protocol is webscocket, only open http port or secure https port, do not use ssh or other insecure ports or restricted ports to achieve real-time monitoring of remote host logs and execute commands

### agent
agent.go is an agent running on a remote host. Once this agent runs, it will automatically register with the server, and then monitor the client's requests forwarded by the    server in real time. Currently, two types of requests are received, one is to monitor log files like the tail command, and the other is to execute system commands. Note: The agent is best to run in the background, such as using nohup to run.The configuration file is: conf.yml. It contains the IP address of the host where the agent is located and the host:port of the server

### server
server.go is a transit server, used to establish a websocket connection between the remote host agent and client, and forward the message correctly.Note: The server runs on port 8001 by default, of course, you can also specify the port like this: go run server.go 8002

### rrc client
rrc.go is a client that executes system commands on a remote host. The calling method is as follows:go run rrc.go 192.168.1.3 ls /root. The configuration file is client_conf.yml. It contains the host:port of the server. For the convenience of running in the project, I compile and run rrc, which can be placed in the PATH path, and the configuration file and the rrc executable file can be in the same directory. you can run rrc command like this: rrc 192.168.1.2 ls /root
### wrf client
wrf.go wrf.go is a command to monitor log files on remote hosts in real time. The execution command is as follows: go run wrf.go 192.168.1.123 /var/log/messages. The configuration file is client_conf.yml. It contains the host:port of the server. For the convenience of running in the project, I compile and run wrf, which can be placed in the PATH path, and the configuration file and wrf executable file can be in the same directory. you can run wrf command like this: wrf 192.168.1.3 /var/log/messages
